E-Nose based Ignitable Liquids Detection via Gas  Sensors Screening and a Domain Adaptation Algorithm

This repository supports the paper “E-Nose based Ignitable-Liquid Detection via Gas-Sensor Screening and a Domain-Adaptation Algorithm.” As there are still some tasks under review, we will release the complete code in this paper and every dataset used in our experiments upon acceptance—ready for immediate community adoption and further research.
