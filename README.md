E-Nose based Ignitable Liquids Detection via Gas  Sensors Screening and a Domain Adaptation Algorithm

This repository supports the paper “E-Nose based Ignitable-Liquid Detection via Gas-Sensor Screening and a Domain-Adaptation Algorithm.” Upon acceptance, we will release the complete SKFA-CNN implementation, reproducible code for all comparison methods, the full ablation-study parameter log, and every dataset used in our experiments—ready for immediate community adoption and further research.
